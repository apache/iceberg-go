// RowDelta encodes a set of row-level changes to a table: new data files
// (inserts) and delete files (equality or position deletes). A delta
// that replaces a data file's deletion vector can remove the superseded
// DV via [RowDelta.RemoveDeletes]. All changes are committed atomically
// in a single snapshot.
//
// The operation type of the produced snapshot is determined automatically:
//   - Data files only → OpAppend
//   - Delete files only → OpDelete
//   - Both data and delete files → OpOverwrite
//
// This matches the semantics of Java's BaseRowDelta. It is the primary
// API for CDC/streaming workloads where INSERTs, UPDATEs, and DELETEs
// must be committed together.
//
// Client-side conflict validation runs before the commit is sent to
// the catalog:
//   - Position deletes: referenced data files must still be reachable
//     from the current branch head (validateDataFilesExist).
//   - Equality deletes under write.delete.isolation-level=serializable
//     (the default): concurrent data files in the same partition(s) as
//     the equality deletes are rejected. For partitioned tables an
//     OR-of-equalities filter is built from the eq-delete files'
//     partition tuples and routed through validateAddedDataFilesMatchingFilter
//     (spec-evolution safe, manifest-summary pruning, type-aware evaluation).
//     For unpartitioned tables the check is conservative (AlwaysTrue —
//     any concurrent append is a conflict). Opt out by setting
//     write.delete.isolation-level=snapshot.
//
// The pre-flight runs before cat.CommitTable on every commit attempt.
// On the first attempt the writer's view and the catalog state are the
// same, so there are no concurrent snapshots to inspect and the checks
// short-circuit; on retries doCommit refreshes the catalog state and
// the checks run against the freshly loaded branch head.
//

// write a DV containing all of the previous DV's positions and remove
// the previous DV in the same snapshot. RemoveDeletes is the removal
// half of that contract; Commit validates that every removed DV's
// referenced data file gets a replacement DV among the files passed to
// AddDeletes, so the delta cannot silently resurrect deleted rows.
//
// Only deletion vectors (Puffin position deletes with a referenced
// data file) can be removed here. Expunging fully-applied position or
// equality delete files belongs to the rewrite path
// ([Transaction.ReplaceFiles] / [RewriteFiles]), which owns the
// data-file replacement validation that makes such removals safe.
//
// Removal identity is (file path, referenced data file): a multi-blob
// Puffin file may carry deletion vectors for several data files under
// one path, and removing one of its entries leaves the others live.
// When exactly one live entry carries the removed file's path, it is
// selected regardless of the caller copy's (possibly stale) reference;
// when several live entries share the path, the removed file's
// ReferencedDataFile selects which entry to remove, and Commit rejects
// the removal as ambiguous if it does not identify exactly one.
//
// Removal resolution is snapshot-relative, so a commit carrying
// removals is never replayed on an optimistic-concurrency conflict: if
// a concurrent writer advances the branch first, Commit's transaction
// fails with ErrCommitFailed instead of retrying, and the caller must
// reload the table and rebuild the delta against the fresh snapshot.
