// `scan-planning-mode` (values `client`/`server`), which is a server directive
// resolved separately (OQ4): a `client` table forces local planning, a `server`
// table forces remote planning, and explicit conflicting scan options fail
// fast. There is intentionally no fourth `server` value here; the directive
// lives in the table config, not the user option.

// Delivery contract (OQ1): a returned ScanPlanningResult.IO is stored on the
// Scan that planned it; every ReadTasks call loads from it instead of the

// closes after its remaining scan owners and active record iterators finish.
// Call Scan.Close when the scan is no longer needed, including when planning
// succeeds but its tasks are not read. Close is idempotent and waits for active
// ReadTasks iterators before the plan IO is closed.
// This ties a plan-scoped scan to PlanFiles -> ReadTasks: tasks from a remote
// plan must be read by the Scan that produced them or one of its derived scans.

// table.New sets Table.planner when the supplied CatalogIO also implements
// ScanPlanner; Table.Scan copies that planner into Scan. This chooses the
// Catalog -> Table -> Scan wiring now.
//
// (*Scan).PlanFiles resolves planningMode and, for remote/auto with a capable
// planner, delegates to planner.PlanFiles and stores any returned PlanIO on the
// Scan for ReadTasks. Auto without a capable planner runs the existing local
// path unchanged; remote without one fails loudly instead of silently planning
// locally. The compile-time `var _ table.ScanPlanner = (*Catalog)(nil)` in
// catalog/rest proves the REST catalog satisfies the planner interface.
