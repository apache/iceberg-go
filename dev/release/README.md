# Release

## Overview

    1. Test the revision to be released
    2. Prepare RC and vote (detailed later)
    3. Publish (detailed later)

### Prepare RC and vote

Run `dev/release/release_rc.sh` on a working copy of 
`git@github.com:apache/iceberg-go` not from your fork:

```console
$ git clone git@github.com:apache/iceberg-go.git
$ dev/release/release_rc.sh ${VERSION} ${RC}
(Send a vote email to dev@iceberg.apache.org.
 You can use a draft shown by release_rc.sh for the email.)
```

Here is an example to release RC1:

```console
$ GH_TOKEN=${YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN} dev/release/release_rc.sh 1.0.0 1
```

The arguments of `release_rc.sh` are the version and the RC number. If RC1 has a problem, we'll increment the RC number such as RC2, RC3 and so on.

Requirements to run `release_rc.sh`:

    * You must be an Apache Iceberg committer or PMC member
    * You must prepare your PGP key for signing

If you don't have a PGP key, https://infra.apache.org/release-signing.html#generate
may be helpful.

Your PGP key must be registered to the following:

    * https://downloads.apache.org/iceberg/KEYS

See the header comment of them for how to add a PGP key.

Apache Iceberg committers can update them by Subversion client with their ASF account.
e.g.:

```console
$ svn co https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/iceberg
$ cd iceberg
$ editor KEYS
$ svn ci KEYS
```

### Publish

We need to do the following to publish a new release:

    * Publish to apache.org

Run `dev/release/release.sh` to publish to apache.org:

```console
$ GH_TOKEN=${YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN} dev/release/release.sh ${VERSION} ${RC}
```

Add the release to ASF's report database via [Apache Committee Report Helper](https://reporter.apache.org/addrelease.html?iceberg)

### Verify

We have a script for verifying a RC.

You must install the following to run the script:

    * `curl`
    * `gpg`
    * `shasum` or `sha256sum`/`sha512sum`
    * `tar`

You don't need to have Go installed, if it isn't on the system the latest Go will be
automatically downloaded and used only for verification.

To verify a RC, run the following:

```console
$ dev/release/verify_rc.sh ${VERSION} ${RC}
```

If the verification is successful, the message `RC looks good!` is shown.
