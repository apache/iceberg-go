### Read/Write Data Support

* Data can currently be read as an Arrow Table or as a stream of Arrow record batches.

#### Supported Write Operations

As long as the FileSystem is supported and the Catalog supports altering
the table, the following tracks the current write support:

| Operation         |Supported|
|:-----------------:|:-------:|
| Append Stream     |   X     |
| Append Data Files |   X     |
| Rewrite Files     |         |
| Rewrite manifests |         |
| Overwrite Files   |         |
| Write Pos Delete  |         |
| Write Eq Delete   |         |
| Row Delta         |         |


### CLI Usage
Run `go build ./cmd/iceberg` from the root of this repository to build the CLI executable, alternately you can run `go install github.com/apache/iceberg-go/cmd/iceberg` to install it to the `bin` directory of your `GOPATH`.

The `iceberg` CLI usage is very similar to [pyiceberg CLI](https://py.iceberg.apache.org/cli/) \
You can pass the catalog URI with `--uri` argument.

Example:
You can start the Iceberg REST API docker image which runs on default in port `8181`
```
docker pull apache/iceberg-rest-fixture:latest
docker run -p 8181:8181 apache/iceberg-rest-fixture:latest
```
and run the `iceberg` CLI pointing to the REST API server.

```
 ./iceberg --uri http://0.0.0.0:8181 list
┌─────┐
| IDs |
| --- |
└─────┘
```
**Create Namespace**
```
./iceberg --uri http://0.0.0.0:8181 create namespace taxitrips
```

**List Namespace**
```
 ./iceberg --uri http://0.0.0.0:8181 list
┌───────────┐
| IDs       |
| --------- |
| taxitrips |
└───────────┘
