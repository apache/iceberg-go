# Tests of the gocdk-blob program.

# ROOTDIR_URL is a platform-specific environment variable set
# in main_test.go.

# Create a subdirectory so we can use fileblob.
$ mkdir bucket

# List an empty bucket: valid, but no output.
$ gocdk-blob ls ${ROOTDIR_URL}/bucket

$ fecho hello.txt hello world
$ gocdk-blob upload ${ROOTDIR_URL}/bucket hw < hello.txt

$ gocdk-blob ls ${ROOTDIR_URL}/bucket
hw

$ gocdk-blob download ${ROOTDIR_URL}/bucket hw
hello world

# Error downloading a bucket that doesn't exist.
# For now we can't use this test case, because the output won't be the same across operating systems.
#$ gocdk-blob download ${ROOTDIR_URL}/bucket noexist --> FAIL
#gocdk-blob: Failed to read "noexist": blob (code=NotFound): stat ${SLASHDIR}/bucket/noexist: no such file or directory
