# Guestbook Sample

Guestbook is a sample application that records visitors' messages, displays a
cloud banner, and an administrative message. The main business logic is written
in a cloud-agnostic manner using MySQL, the generic blob API, and the generic
runtimevar API. All platform-specific code is set up by
[Wire](https://github.com/google/wire).

The [online tutorial](https://gocloud.dev/tutorials/guestbook) will walk you through how to build, run, and deploy this sample locally, on Google Cloud Platform (GCP), on Amazon Web Servicess (AWS), or on Microsoft Azure.
